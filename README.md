## Introduction

Customer churn refers to the loss of clients or customers. For banks, understanding and predicting churn is crucial to developing strategies to retain customers. This project involves various stages of data processing, feature engineering, and model training using machine learning algorithms to predict customer churn accurately.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:
